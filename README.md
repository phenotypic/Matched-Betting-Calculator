# Matched-Betting-Calculator

This script functions as a calculator for a number of [matched betting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matched_betting) variations. The betting types supported are:

1. Qualifying bet
2. Free bet (SNR)
3. Free bet (SR)
4. Lost bet refund

The script assumes you have found the most optimal decimal back/lay odds for the type of bet you are performing.

After running the script and entering the required information, you will be given the calculated lay stake, the estimated liability, and the overall profitability for the bet.
